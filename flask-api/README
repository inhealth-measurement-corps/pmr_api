Route Handling(GET request only):
To test if API is up and running: http://127.0.0.1:5000/ 
Should return "Hello World!"

To test if database is connected: http://127.0.0.1:5000/hello 
Should return "Connected to inHealth Database"

Data retreiving routes: http://127.0.0.1:5000/clinician/patient/today/<rmId>
						http://127.0.0.1:5000/clinician/patient/week/<rmId>
						http://127.0.0.1:5000/clinician/patient/month/<rmId>

Please ask the project manager for database's username and password and set them as environment variables.
For Mac/Linux, environment varaibles should be stored in .bash_profile with the format: 
export secret_varaible_name = "secret_key"
